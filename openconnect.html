<h1>OpenConnect</h1>

<P>OpenConnect is a client for Cisco's <A HREF="http://www.cisco.com/web/go/sslvpn">AnyConnect SSL VPN</A>, which is supported by the ASA5500 Series, by IOS 12.4(9)T or later on Cisco SR500, 870, 880, 1800, 2800, 3800, 7200 Series and Cisco 7301 Routers, and probably others.</P>

<P>OpenConnect is released under the GNU Lesser Public License, version 2.1.</P>

<P>Like <A HREF="http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~massar/vpnc/">vpnc</A>,
OpenConnect is not officially supported by, or associated in any way
with, Cisco Systems. It just happens to interoperate with their
equipment.
<P>
Development of OpenConnect was started after a trial of their "official"
client under Linux found it to have many deficiencies:
<UL>
  <LI>Inability to use SSL certificates from a <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module">TPM</A>, or even use a passphrase.</LI>
  <LI>Lack of support for Linux platforms other than i386.</LI>
  <LI>Lack of integration with NetworkManager on the Linux desktop.</LI>
  <LI>Lack of proper (RPM/DEB) packaging for Linux distributions.</LI>
  <LI>"Stealth" use of libraries with <TT>dlopen()</TT>, even using
      the development-only symlinks such as <TT>libz.so</TT> &mdash;
      making it hard to properly discover the dependencies which
      proper packaging would have expressed</LI>
  <LI>Tempfile races allowing unprivileged users to trick it into overwriting arbitrary files, as root.</LI>
  <LI>Unable to run as an unprivileged user, which would have reduced the severity of the above bug.</LI>
  <LI>Inability to audit the source code for further such "Security 101" bugs.</LI>
</UL>

Naturally, OpenConnect addresses all of the above issues, and more.

<H2>Getting started</H2>

Before you get dismayed by the badly laid out information below,
here's a simple intro to using OpenConnect.
<OL>

  <LI>Install OpenConnect.<BR>
      Some distributions like Fedora have packages; otherwise you can
      download it and type '<TT>make</TT>' to build it. To build it,
      you'll want development packages for <TT>libxml2</TT>, <TT>zlib</TT>
      and obviously <TT>OpenSSL</TT> to be installed.
  </LI>
  <LI>Install a <TT>vpnc-script</TT>.<BR>
      This script is what sets up all the addresses and routes for you; it's the
      same as <TT>vpnc</TT>'s. You can get one from <A HREF="http://git.infradead.org/users/dwmw2/vpnc-scripts.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/vpnc-script">here</A> if you don't have one &mdash; or if you need IPv6 or Solaris support, which the <TT>vpnc</TT> version lacks. <I>(Note that the script needs to be executable, and stored somewhere where SELinux or similar security setups won't prevent the root user from accessing it.)</I></LI>
  <LI>Connect to your server, running as root:<BR>
      <TT>openconnect --script /etc/vpnc/vpnc-script https://vpn.mycompany.com/</TT></LI>
</OL>

That should be it, if you have a password-based login. If you use
certificates, you'll need to tell OpenConnect where to find the
certificate with the <TT>-c</TT> option. You might need to steal the
certificate from your Windows certificate store using a tool like <A
HREF="https://www.isecpartners.com/jailbreak.html">Jailbreak</A>.
<P>
You can ignore anything you see below about needing to patch OpenSSL
so that DTLS works &mdash; you don't really need it, although it will
make your connections much faster if you're experiencing packet loss
between you and the VPN server. But you can worry about that later.



<H2>Supported Platforms</H2>

OpenConnect is known to work on Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, OpenSolaris
and Mac OS X platforms, and should be trivially portable to any other platform
supporting <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUN/TAP">TUN/TAP</a>
devices and on which <A HREF="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> runs.
IPv6 support is tested on Linux, FreeBSD and OpenSolaris.<P>

For Solaris support, and for IPv6 on any platform, the
<tt>vpnc-script</tt> shipped with vpnc itself (as of v0.5.3)
is not sufficient. It is necessary to use the script from my <A
HREF="http://git.infradead.org/users/dwmw2/vpnc-scripts.git">vpnc-scripts</A>
repository instead.

<P>
It is known to work on at least i386, x86_64, PowerPC and MIPS
processors, and should not have issues with portability to other CPUs.
<P>Note that 'Cisco Secure Desktop' support may require the ability to run Linux/i386 binaries; see <A HREF="#csd">below</A>.</P>

<H2>Features</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Connection through HTTP proxy, including <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/libproxy/">libproxy</A> support for automatic proxy configuration.</LI>
  <LI>Connection through SOCKS5 proxy.</LI>
  <LI>Automatic detection of IPv4 and IPv6 address, routes.</LI>
  <LI>Authentication via HTTP forms.</LI>
      <LI>Authentication using SSL certificates, from local file or <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module">Trusted Platform Module</A>.</LI>
  <LI><I>UserGroup</I> support for selecting between multiple configurations on a single VPN server.</LI>
  <LI>Data transport over TCP <I>(HTTPS)</I> or UDP <I>(DTLS)</I>.</LI>
  <LI>Keepalive and Dead Peer Detection on both HTTPS and DTLS.</LI>
  <LI>Automatic update of VPN server list / configuration.</LI>
  <LI>Roaming support, allowing reconnection when the local IP address changes.</LI>
  <LI>Run without root privileges.</LI>
  <LI>"Cisco Secure Desktop" support <I>(see below)</I>.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Running as non-root</H3>
There are two ways that OpenConnect can run without root
privileges. The first is that it can use a tun device which is created
in advance by the root user, and set to be owned by the user who runs
OpenConnect.<P>

The second is that it can avoid using the tun device altogether and
instead spawn a user-supplied program, passing all data traffic
through a UNIX socket to that program.  This latter option can be used
in conjunction with a userspace TCP stack such as <A
HREF="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/">lwip</A> to provide
SOCKS access to the VPN without giving full access to all untrusted
users and processes on the computer, and without requiring root
privileges at all.

<H3><A NAME="csd">Cisco Secure Desktop</A></H3>

The 'Cisco Secure Desktop' is a bit of a misnomer &mdash; it works by
downloading a trojan binary from the server and running it on your
client machine to perform some kind of 'verification' and post its
approval back to the server. This seems anything <em>but</em> secure
to me, especially given their history of trivially-exploitable
bugs.<P>
It's also fairly easy to subvert, by running your own modified binary
instead of the one you download from the server. Or by running their
binary but poking at it with gdb.<P>
We support this idiocy, but because of the security concerns the
trojan will be executed only if a userid is specified on the command
line using the <TT>--csd-user=</TT> option, or the <TT>--csd-wrapper=</TT>
option is used to handle the script in a 'safe' manner.
<P>
This support currently only works when the server has a Linux binary
installed, and only when that Linux binary runs on the client machine.


<H2>Mailing list</H2>

There is a mailing list at <TT><A
HREF="mailto:openconnect-devel@lists.infradead.org">
openconnect-devel@lists.infradead.org</A></TT>. To subscribe, visit the <A
HREF="http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/openconnect-devel">Mailman admin page</A>. Before posting to the list, read this:
<P>
<B>SECURITY WARNING:</B><BR>
If you are posting debugging output from openconnect to the mailing list, do <em>not</em> include a line which looks like this:

<BR><TT>Set-Cookie: webvpn=835278264@921600@1221512527@6B9EC24DEB2F59E242F75B424D42F223D0912984;PATH=/</TT><BR>
That HTTP cookie is all that's needed to grant access to the VPN session you just logged in to &mdash; it's almost as bad as giving your password away. Version 2.26 or later of OpenConnect will automatically filter this out of the debugging output for you.

<H2>TODO</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Testing IPv6 on more platforms (only Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris are tested so far).</LI>
  <LI>Better support for running or emulating the 'Cisco Secure Desktop' trojan.</LI>
  <LI>More platform support: Windows, Symbian, etc.</LI>
  <LI>GUI for OS X, perhaps based on <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/">Tunnelblick</A>.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Platform support for new UNIX systems is relatively simple to add
&mdash; most of the difference is in the TUN/TAP device handling, and
the major variants of that are already supported.
<P>
A port to Windows should be fairly simple, since a TUN/TAP driver
exists for Windows and Cygwin should make the basic port work OK.
<P>
A port to Symbian, to provide VPN connectivity on phone handsets,
would be very useful. Any volunteers?

<H2>NetworkManager support</H2>

Support for OpenConnect in NetworkManager has been integrated into
GNOME git and is released alongside NetworkManager's other VPN modules:
<A HREF="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/NetworkManager-openconnect/">
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/NetworkManager-openconnect/</A>.<P>

Unlike other VPN support in NetworkManager, the <TT>auth-dialog</TT>
tool which handles GUI authentication is part of OpenConnect itself,
rather than included in the <TT>network-manager-openconnect</TT>
package. This is because it shares a lot of code with OpenConnect, but
doesn't actually share any with NetworkManager or the other parts of
the NetworkManager support.<P>
<B>Note for KDE users:</B> knetworkmanager does not yet support OpenConnect. See <A HREF="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=226028">KDE bug #226028</A>.

<H2>ConnMan support</H2>

<A HREF="http://connman.net/">ConnMan</A> has basic support for OpenConnect
as from version 0.48. However, GUI support for VPNs is not yet implemented.

<H2>Requirements</H2>
The basic text-mode client uses the following libraries:
<UL>
  <LI><B>OpenSSL</B> &mdash; ideally at least 0.9.8m, although all versions from 0.9.7 onwards will work for basic connectivity. See note on DTLS compatibility below.</LI>
  <LI><B>libxml2</B></LI>
  <LI><B>zlib</B></LI>
  <LI><B><A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/libproxy/">libproxy</A></B> <I>(optionally)</I></LI>
</UL>
Mac OS X users will also need to install the
<A HREF="http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/">Mac OS X tun/tap driver</A>, and Solaris users will need the <A HREF="http://www.whiteboard.ne.jp/~admin2/tuntap/">Solaris one</A>. Note that for IPv6 support, the Solaris tun/tap driver from 16th Nov 2009 or newer is required.<P>

For building the NetworkManager support, you will also need:
<UL>
  <LI><B>GTK</B></LI>
  <LI><B>GConf</B></LI>
</UL>

Patches converting OpenConnect from libxml2 to something more compact like expat would be welcomed...


<HR>
<H2>How the VPN works</H2>

The VPN is extremely simple, based almost entirely on the standard
HTTPS and <A HREF="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4347.txt">DTLS</A>
protocols. You connect to the secure web server, authenticate using
certificates and/or arbitrary web forms, and you are rewarded with a
standard HTTP cookie.<P>

You then use this cookie in an HTTP <TT>CONNECT</TT> request, and can
then pass traffic over that connection. IP addresses and routing
information are passed back and forth in the headers of that
<TT>CONNECT</TT> request.<P>

Since <A HREF="http://sites.inka.de/~W1011/devel/tcp-tcp.html">TCP
over TCP is very suboptimal</A>, the VPN also attempts to use UDP
datagrams, and will only <em>actually</em> pass traffic over the HTTPS
connection if that fails. The UDP connectivity is done using Datagram
TLS, which is supported by OpenSSL.


<H2>OpenSSL/DTLS compatibility</H2>

<I><B>Note: DTLS is optional and not required for basic connectivity, as explained above.</B></I><P>

Unfortunately, Cisco used an old version of OpenSSL for their server,
which predates the official RFC and has a few differences in the
implementation of DTLS.
<P>
Compatibility support for their "speshul" version of the protocol is
in the 0.9.8m and later releases of OpenSSL (and 1.0.0-beta2 and later).
<P>

If you are using an older version of OpenSSL, DTLS will
only work if you apply this patch from OpenSSL CVS:
<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=18037">http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=18037</A> (OpenSSL <A HREF="http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=1751&user=guest&pass=guest">RT#1751</A>)</LI>
</UL>

For versions older than 0.9.8j, some generic DTLS bug fixes are also required:

Debian's OpenSSL packages include all required patches for DTLS compatibility in unstable and testing.<P>
<H3>Ubuntu</H3>
Reasonably current versions of the required packages are finally included in Ubuntu 10.04 "Lucid". Older releases still have <A HREF="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/+bug/516318">out of date OpenSSL</A> and <A HREF="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openconnect/+bug/516324">out of date OpenConnect which doesn't work around the latest Cisco bugs</A>.
<H3>Gentoo</H3>
<A HREF="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=263097">Gentoo bug #263097</A> has been filed, asking for <TT>openconnect</TT> to be packaged.
<H3>NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, etc. <i>(pkgsrc)</i></H3>
There are packages for <A HREF="http://pkgsrc-wip.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/pkgsrc-wip/wip/vpnc-script/">vpnc-script</A> and <A HREF="http://pkgsrc-wip.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/pkgsrc-wip/wip/openconnect/">openconnect</A> in the pkgsrc-wip repository <I>(<A HREF="http://pkgsrc-wip.sourceforge.net/">pkgsrc-wip.sf.net</A>)</I>.
<H3>FreeBSD</H3>
An <TT>openconnect</TT> <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/security/openconnect/">port</A> is available for FreeBSD. FreeBSD does not yet ship a version of OpenSSL which supports Cisco's "speshul" version of DTLS.
